# Beginning Bootstrap
===================

A ground up learning tool for the Bootstrap 3 framework. Go from nothing to something!

Beginning Bootstrap is focused on helping you build a project, or act as a reference, in an interactive learning way. It's not just documentation and resources, Beginning Bootstrap will be focused on heuristic learning and helping people not only get information, but understand the "why" and "how" of the Bootstrap framework and paradigm.

This will be an open source project where anyone who wants to provide value can contribute, be it code, lessions, articles, or anything else.
